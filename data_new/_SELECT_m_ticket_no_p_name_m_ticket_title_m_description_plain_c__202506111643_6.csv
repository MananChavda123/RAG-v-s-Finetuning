So we have checked form our end where we concluded that this might not ahhopend so it requires QA team assiatnce for further resolution .
For referenceWe took a remote session with the user and identified that the user is facing an issue involving both the Attendance and Access Control modules.

The issue occurs when the user assigns specific door access in the Access Control module. After saving the changes, the system incorrectly shows the ""All Allow"" access group under the user, instead of the assigned specific access.

We have checked from our end and concluded that this behavior should not occur. Therefore, we are escalating the issue for further investigation and require assistance from the QA team.

For reference, snapshots are attached. Please review and do the needful.

T029877,iApp,Lapsed C-off in Annual Leave Card,"Hello Sandip,

 

In reference to our discussion, we have created separate code for C-off 2025 to manage the c-off balance effectively from January 2025 and all previous C-off balance (for the previous year 2024) are tagged in different leave code (C-off 2024):

 

In order to creation of new C-off leave code, we would like to understand the arrangement made by you for the lapsed C-off balance in annual leave card reports.

 

e.g. Mr. X has earned 3 C-off Balance in January 2025 and utilized 1 C-off in March 2025, However later he has not used any leave balance of C-off till April 2025, How this lapsed C-off balance will be appeared in Annual Leave card and how can we track the real time balance of C-off in Leave reports.

 

Seeking clarification on above points on priority.

 

Regards,

Dharmesh Prajapati

","Hi Zeel,
In the case of future dates, whether it's a holiday or a working day, the system marks the day as Absent. This behavior is consistent and is not affected by whether reprocessing occurs after the holiday transaction. Therefore, our RCA does not align with the actual system behavior.

","Hi Zeel,

The SUN Team has mentioned that this case is not related to reprocessing.

Example:
A future-dated punch was marked for the month of November on:

Saturday (01-11-2025)

Sunday (02-11-2025)

Monday (03-11-2025)

Later, we added a holiday on Sunday (02-11-2025). Since the punches are future-dated, and the days before and after the holiday are marked as absent, the system shows the attendance status as absent even after reprocessing.

The current RCA (Root Cause Analysis) does not align with this behavior.
Please review and confirm.","In this case, the issue originally occurred in March 2024, when an optional holiday was assigned but the status incorrectly showed as Present instead of Absent. This was related to a reprocessing issue.

However, the user reported that visitors are still able to access Turnstiles 1 to 12, despite being assigned only to the Visitor access group for Turnstile 13.

To investigate further, we asked one visitor to punch on a device. In the transaction logs, the result shows ""Access Denied for Door"", but the user mentioned that the device (Face Scribe) displayed ""Access Allowed"" during the punch. Despite this, the turnstile did not open.

We checked the List Management section of the Face Scribe device where the visitor was able to punch and deleted the corresponding user details from the device. After this action, the visitor was no longer able to punch on devices belonging to a different access group.

However, as the user pointed out, it is not feasible to perform this manual deletion for every visitor or employee, and a permanent solution is needed.

We discussed this with our internal team and concluded that a firmware/version update is required to resolve the issue permanently.",After revoke the access group and assign the access group then after issue has been resolved

Thanks","We conducted a remote session with the user and found that an access group was assigned to an employee. This access group is configured with only one device.

However, the issue is that after assigning the access, the employee is still able to punch on all other turnstiles, including the assigned door. Upon investigation, we found that the access command was sent to the selected device only. Despite this, the employee's entry appeared in the Face Portal's list management at the time of access assignment. As a result, there is an entry in the list management that allows the employee to access other doors, although it does not open the turnstiles.

In conclusion:

The access command should not propagate to other doors.

Once access is assigned, any previous access to remaining doors should be removed.

The employee's face data should also be deleted from list management for unauthorized doors.

Please find all the required documents attached and do the needful.",After revoke the access group and assign the access group then after issue has been resolved

T029924,iApp,Technical Guidance Required: Duplicate Access Card Series Issue,"Hi Sandip, Hope you're doing well. I’m reaching out for your technical guidance regarding an issue we’re facing with a batch of 100 access cards recently procured from a different vendor. This is the first time I'm connecting with your team, and I’d really appreciate your input on whether there’s any workaround or configuration method we can consider. Issue Summary: The access cards delivered to us have a number of series that already exists in our system. When we try configuring the new cards (e.g., using the start 5 digits), the system still identifies them as existing cards, leading to conflicts. Swiping the new cards results in the card reader logging entries tied to old/existing card IDs. Our Concern: The vendor is yet to confirm if they will replace the cards. In the meantime, we would like to understand: From a technical standpoint, is there any way these cards can still be used or reconfigured to work independently from the existing ones? Could a software-side setting or reprogramming resolve the clash, or is replacement the only viable option? I’ve attached reference images of the new and old card data for your reference in case that helps. Please let me know your thoughts or if you need any additional information to assess the scenario. Looking forward to your guidance. Kind",forward to Sandip.,"This client is not under AMC and is an SI client who purchased the product directly from the vendor.

Next, I carefully configured the Wi-Fi frequency to operate at 2.4 GHz, a common choice for its wider range coverage and compatibility with various devices. This step was crucial in optimizing the network performance for the client's specific needs. Subsequently, I guided the client through the steps required to connect to the newly configured Wi-Fi network using the designated biot application. This involved them through the application interface and assisting them in inputting the required information, such as the network name (SSID) and the secure password. Once the client successfully inputted the necessary details, the connection was established between their device and the Wi-Fi network. This ensured that they could seamlessly access the internet and other network resources without any disruptions. Furthermore, recognizing the importance of ensuring continuous connectivity, I provided clear instructions to the client on how to reconnect to the Wi-Fi network in case of any disconnection issues. This included troubleshooting steps such as restarting the device, checking for any interference, and verifying the Wi-Fi settings. By empowering the client with this knowledge, I aimed to minimize any potential downtime and ensure a smooth user experience with their newly configured Wi-Fi network.

T029944,,Compatibility & Upgrade Clarification – Netx to iApp System,"Dear Support Team, We are currently planning to upgrade one of our client's existing Netx Access Control System to the latest iApp platform. The site is equipped with two types of fingerprint door controllers: Biostamp + Biostamp 2C We request your guidance and clarification on the following points to plan this upgrade smoothly: 1. Controller Compatibility with iApp Are Biostamp + and Biostamp 2C controllers fully compatible with the iApp software? If compatible, do we need to perform any firmware upgrades on these controllers to work with iApp? What is the recommended procedure to migrate from Netx to iApp using the existing controller setup?

2. Device Setup: I collected the device from the client; however, it lacked a power cable. I retrieved a compatible power cable from the security department, connected both the power and LAN cables, and successfully powered on the device.
3. IP Assignment: I coordinated with the corporate IT team to assign a new IP address to the device. I provided them with the current IP range in use at Zydus Corporate Park and the device's MAC address. The IT team then assigned the appropriate IP address.
4. Device Configuration: I manually entered all necessary device parameters. Afterward, I pinged the device from the Zydus server, confirming its successful activation.

6. Device Addition: While attempting to add the new device, I encountered an error stating that the device IP was already assigned. Upon

The client reported that when employee ID **11177** attempted to apply for leave from **30/03/2025 to 07/04/2025**, the system was also counting weekly offs, and the **sandwich exception** was not being applied.
2. I checked the employee's attendance sheet and found that the **payroll cycle for the month of March was already closed**, which is why the sandwich leave logic was not being considered.
3. I then navigated to the employee's **Leave Group Policy**, edited the sandwich rule, and found that the **exception limit was set to 8**. I updated the exception to **9** and saved the policy.
4. After updating the policy, I reapplied the 8-day leave. The system now correctly applied the sandwich exception, and the **leave balance was adjusted to 6**, correctly excluding the weekly offs.
5. The issue has now been resolved, and the leave balance is displaying correctly.","1. The client reported that when employee ID **11177** attempted to apply for leave from **30/03/2025 to 07/04/2025**, the system was also counting weekly offs, and the **sandwich exception** was not being applied.

Overtime is indeed being generated; however, the corresponding Compensatory Off (COFF) leave is not being granted. This behavior is due to the conditions defined in the overtime policy.

Please refer to the attached screenshots for a better understanding.

Details:

Overtime Policy Configuration for Normal Days:
The condition is set such that if the overtime hours are greater than or equal to 23:59 hours, only then 0.5 leave is granted.

Template Configuration:
The template is configured to calculate overtime hours (extrahour_day) across all types of days—normal days, week-offs, and holidays. It returns a maximum of 8 hours as overtime/COFF hours if the extrahour_day is 8 or more hours.

Due to this configuration, while overtime is being calculated correctly based on the template, COFF leave is not being generated, as the policy condition for normal days is not being met.

Recommendation:
To resolve this, you need to update the overtime policy configuration for normal days so that it aligns with the template logic and allows COFF leave to be generated appropriately.

Please let us know if you need assistance with updating the configuration.",Solved

To facilitate our internal assessment and resolution process, we kindly request comprehensive details for each of these points. Providing specific examples will greatly assist us in replicating and addressing the issues effectively.

Points Requiring Additional Details:
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 17, 18, 19

Comments on Points with Provided Details:

    Point 5: After an employee is blocked and subsequently unblocked in the I-App, they are unable to punch in at their designated machine, receiving an ""access denied"" error, which also appears for canteen access.
    Comment: Post-unblocking, it is essential to reassign access to the employee via the 'Assign Access' menu. You can verify the success of this action by checking the status command on the respective device.

    Point 13: The punching machine's time is not updating correctly, with discrepancies of approximately 15 to 20 minutes.
    Comment: The latest software version includes an option to synchronize time automatically every 3–4 hours. Additionally, manual synchronization of date and time is available through the 'Sync' option in the database menu. Persistent issues may indicate an RTC-related hardware problem.

    Point 14: Punching machines at GN3, GN2, GN4, GN5, HOD, and GN7 are not functioning properly.
    Comment: Upon inspection of the Zydus server, devices GN3 and GN4 show inactive IPs. The remaining devices are active within the software, and data is downloading correctly.

    Point 16: Biomini installation has been pending for two PCs over the past 3–4 months.
    Comment: On 09/05/2025, I coordinated with Mr. Nilay, and the biomini installation was completed on Mr. Hiren's system. He has been guided through the process and confirmed that he will handle the installation on the remaining system independently.

    Point 20: New employee numbers are appearing in the I-App with significant delays.
    Comment: Our team has conducted a thorough check and found no issues on the Spectra side. The Zydus and Darwinbox teams are currently collaborating to resolve this matter.
","1. The client reported that some employees were granted access to areas where they should not have access. Despite not having the required area permissions, the system shows “Access Allowed” when they punch on certain devices.
2. I opened the database menu in the software and found that all devices are showing as active, except for one device (GN-MSG), which was not visible in the database menu. I then checked the Operations section and found that the device was marked as inactive. I reactivated the device and noted that it had been deactivated by Mr. Devesh Patel.
3. I reviewed the Employee Master under the Miscellaneous menu and observed that multiple employees had “Access Allowed” entries for areas they shouldn't have access to.
4. Upon checking the Access Groups, I found that several devices were incorrectly added to specific access groups. As a result, when access is assigned to an employee, they are also gaining access to other unintended devices. To resolve this, the unnecessary devices need to be removed from the affected access groups."

Upon reviewing the fingerprint parameters across all devices with our technical team, it was determined that these parameters were set to a higher level to prevent cross-punching.


For achieving 100% accuracy and reliable 1:1 fingerprint scanning, we recommend advising the client to use the Card+Finger mode.


To address the current issue, we propose adjusting the image quality setting from Strongest to Moderate. This change is expected to resolve the registration problem; however, please be aware that it may slightly increase the risk of cross-punching.


Please note that every new version we release includes process improvements and enhanced accuracy. The issue faced by the client is related to hardware parameter settings and is not caused by the version update.",

The client reported that the canteen data appears incorrect and that, on one date, duplicate entries are showing for the same item.
2. I opened the Canteen Management module, navigated to the report section, and generated a date-wise item report. I did not find any duplicate entries, so I shared the report with the client. However, the client claimed that when they generated the report, it showed duplicate entries.
3. I requested the client to connect via Microsoft Teams so I could check the issue remotely and resolve the reported concern.
4. During the Teams session, I found that the client was generating the report and sorting it by date only, without sorting the item field. As a result, the items appeared out of order while the dates changed, which made the report look incorrect.
5. No issue was found in the canteen report itself. I guided the client on how to properly sort the report by both item and date. The concern has now been resolved."

Thanks & Regards S.Nageshwar Reddy IPQA","Regarding the reported issue, I would like to clarify that there is no system error. The system is functioning correctly as per the configured policies.

For the GS shift, the shift timings are as follows:

    First Half: 08:30 AM to 12:45 PM

    Second Half: 12:46 PM to 05:00 PM

As per policy, the employee must work a minimum of 4 hours and 15 minutes in each half to be marked present for that half.

The employee’s recorded punches are:

    08:34 IN – 13:33 OUT → Worked 4 hours 59 minutes

    14:44 IN – 17:31 OUT → Worked 2 hours 47 minutes

Based on these timings:

    The employee fulfilled the first half requirement.

    However, the second half falls short of the required working duration (only 2 hours 47 minutes), and therefore is marked absent for the second half.

It was noted that the employee has applied for leave in the first half, which doesn't align with the attendance data. To resolve this and ensure the correct attendance marking, the leave should be applied for the second half instead.","Regarding the reported issue, I would like to clarify that there is no system error.

As a next step, we assigned Tenant Admin rights to the user, but the issue remains unresolved.

This appears to require intervention from the senior technical team for further investigation and resolution.

Requesting your support in addressing this at the earliest.

However, when the employee attempted to apply for another COFF on 28th April, the COFF balance was not visible.

Upon reviewing the Overtime Policy, we found that the policy states:
“If the overtime working hours are 8 or more, the user will be eligible for 1 COFF leave.”

In this case, the employee had worked for 7 hours and 50 minutes, which is 10 minutes short of the required threshold. Therefore, the COFF balance was not generated as per the policy.

Jeyaraman","I have checked the Global Access functionality in the local environment and found that it is working correctly for the BioStamp 2C device. The InterlocationXS command is being sent and executed successfully.
However, upon verifying on the client's remote, I observed that the InterlocationXS command consistently fails for one specific BioStamp 2C device.
Key Observations:
Attempted multiple times – command fails every time for the specific device.
Tried assigning only the default access group (""All Allowed"") – still fails.
When tested with another user, the command succeeds.
However, testing with a different user from the same location also fails.",

Upon investigation, we confirmed that the data was available in iApp but was not reflecting in the third-party table. To resolve this, we performed the following steps to retrieve and restore the missing data:

Created a new table named TPP in a new database called Third Party.

Configured a new Third Party Configuration in iApp with a Date & Time Scheduler.

Logged into SQL DBX and initiated the scheduler for the new table starting from 16th April.

After running the new scheduler, all the missing data was successfully retrieved in the new table.

Took a backup of the live third-party table and deleted the records for the period from 17th to 22nd April.

Executed INSERT queries using the data from the new table to restore it to the live third-party table.

Verified that all the missing data is now available in the third-party table.

Kindly coordinate with the third-party team and request them to refetch the data from the table for the previously missing dates.

Please find the observations for the two points reported:

1) Client wants to move all 10 imported employees from one company to another company:
To achieve this, you will need to delete the 10 imported employees from the current company, and then import them again under the new company. Ensure that the correct company is selected before starting the import process.

2) Client needs to use all surrendered cards of one company in another company:
This is not possible if the card has already been surrendered from one company, as surrendered cards are locked to that company and cannot be reused in another.
However, if a card was not assigned to any employee in the original company and is deleted from that company, then such a card can be reused in another company.",

We would like to explore the feasibility of automating the QR door access to new joiners, using existing spectra application. Current Process: At present, when a new employee joins the organization, the QR access number is manually assigned by our team member, @Tiju Martin. This process creates a dependency. Proposed Automation Requirement: We would like to automate the following: Auto-assignment of QR Access Number: Upon integration of a new joiner’s account, the available QR access number should be auto-assigned. The site code should always be 0. Auto-assignment of Access Group: Automatically assign the “Without Server Global Access Group” (Group Code: 002) applicable PAN India, during new joiner account creation. The objective is to remove the manual step currently performed by @Tiju Martinand ensure that the QR code and access group are assigned automatically as soon as a new joiner’s data is integrated. Could you please confirm if this requirement is technically feasible with Spectra application? If yes, kindly let us know the prerequisites or steps required from our side to enable this.

To support this initiative effectively, the report should: Clearly show unregularized absences (i.e., no approved leave or regularization) Allow for Start Date and End Date filters to define the reporting period Thanks &",Waiting for Client remote,We create a scheduler as per requirement .

Differentiate Access Methods in Logs

 

Attendance system should be able to distinguish between the two access methods:

    Fingerprint: If an employee uses the fingerprint scanner, the event log should show ""Fingerprint"" under the access method column.
    Access Card: If an employee uses the biometric access card, it should show ""Card"" under the access method column.","As discussed, we would like to inform you that, at the moment, the system does not include a feature that identifies whether an employee has punched in using a card or a fingerprint. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. If this feature becomes available in future updates, we will be sure to notify you. In the meantime, please let us know if there's anything else we can assist you with.","As discussed, we would like to inform you that, at the moment, the system does not include a feature that identifies whether an employee has punched in using a card or a fingerprint.

I hope this message finds you well.

 

I am reaching out to bring to your attention an issue regarding the COFF balance for several employees. Although the old COFF balance code has been closed, it appears that the balances for these employees have still been credited and debited to the old code. This seems to be a technical issue within the system. I have attached the relevant reports for your review.

 

Could you please investigate this matter and provide an update at your earliest convenience?

This is the most priority issue.",Forward to Sandip Sir,"Dear Sir,

As per discussion, regarding this case concerning the mismatch and negative balance reflected in the old COff leave code. To address the reported issue, a new COff leave code was created, which effectively resolved the problem. However, at that time, there was no discussion or decision made to zero out or delete the balance of the old COff leave code.

As per audit requirements, we are not permitted to manually reset any leave balance to zero or delete leave codes. Additionally, the 2024 leave code will have no impact on the current leave code. It will only be visible in the leave report when viewing the 2024 leave balance."
T030450,iApp,Invitation to Pending Issue on 17 Dec 2024 | Gentle Reminder,"Dear Sandip,

 

I hope this message finds you well.

 

I am reaching out to bring to your attention an issue regarding the COFF balance for several employees. Although the old COFF balance code has been closed, it appears that the balances for these employees have still been credited and debited to the old code. This seems to be a technical issue within the system. I have attached the relevant reports for your review.

 

Could you please investigate this matter and provide an update at your earliest convenience?

This involved establishing a secure router ID password to safeguard the network from unauthorized access. Next, I carefully configured the Wi-Fi frequency to operate at 2.4 GHz, a common choice for its wider range coverage and compatibility with various devices. This step was crucial in optimizing the network performance for the client's specific needs. Subsequently, I guided the client through the steps required to connect to the newly configured Wi-Fi network using the designated biot application. This involved them through the application interface and assisting them in inputting the required information, such as the network name (SSID) and the secure password. Once the client successfully inputted the necessary details, the connection was established between their device and the Wi-Fi network. This ensured that they could seamlessly access the internet and other network resources without any disruptions. Furthermore, recognizing the importance of ensuring continuous connectivity, I provided clear instructions to the client on how to reconnect to the Wi-Fi network in case of any disconnection issues. This included troubleshooting steps such as restarting the device, checking for any interference, and verifying the Wi-Fi settings. By empowering the client with this knowledge, I aimed to minimize any potential downtime and ensure a smooth user experience with their newly configured Wi-Fi network.

With reference to the trailing email, please accept our sincere apologies for the delay.

The development team had completed the initial work on the reported issue; however, some challenges were encountered during the testing phase, which resulted in the delay.

These issues have since been identified and resolved. The fix is currently under observation to ensure stability and to confirm that the issue does not recur.

We have received confirmation from the development team that the updated package is scheduled for release on June 6. Should it become ready earlier, we will make every effort to release it ahead of schedule and will notify you accordingly.

We will also coordinate the required downtime in advance and proceed with the implementation in a timely and efficient manner.

Thank you for your continued patience and understanding.

T030522,CMS, Issue in Canteen Software,New user addition and deletion could not be updated in all readers—only in the Kattupalli Admin account.,"We have connected with Manikanandan and conducted initial troubleshooting.  Please find our observations and remarks:

    The Canteen Management Software (CMS) desktop application is functioning properly on the server.

    On the client computers, certain device-related functionalities have stopped working, such as the Reader Utility and user addition features.

    Software was previously working correctly on these systems, and no updates or changes have been made from Spectra side.  Therefore, we suspect the issue may be due to recent changes or updates in the client’s IT/network/infrastructure environment.

    On a Windows 10 client machine, we re-registered some supporting files, after which the software started working normally.

    On a Windows 11 machine, we attempted the same steps, but the software still fails to run and throws the below error.

    We suspect a database connectivity issue on the Windows 11 machine. To verify, we attempted to create an ODBC connection, but this also failed.

    Please request your IT/DBA team to, Investigate any recent changes or updates made on the affected systems.  Check and confirm database connectivity between the server and the Windows 11 client.  We plan to reconnect early next week after you confirm.

    CMS is a legacy application. While it can run on Windows 11, it has not been fully tested on this OS.  We do not recommend using CMS on the latest operating systems.

    As CMS does not have an inbuilt logging mechanism, issue tracing is limited, we recommend considering a migration to our latest application – iAPP, which offers enhanced features and compatibility.","Issue is resolved by Prakash.

T030743,BIOT,New device installation in bel road manyavar store,New device installation in bel road manyavar store,"After remotely accessing the system, I initiated the process by inputting the necessary router details, ensuring a seamless configuration process. This involved establishing a secure router ID password to safeguard the network from unauthorized access. Next, I carefully configured the Wi-Fi frequency to operate at 2.4 GHz, a common choice for its wider range coverage and compatibility with various devices. This step was crucial in optimizing the network performance for the client's specific needs. Subsequently, I guided the client through the steps required to connect to the newly configured Wi-Fi network using the designated biot application. This involved them through the application interface and assisting them in inputting the required information, such as the network name (SSID) and the secure password. Once the client successfully inputted the necessary details, the connection was established between their device and the Wi-Fi network. This ensured that they could seamlessly access the internet and other network resources without any disruptions. Furthermore, recognizing the importance of ensuring continuous connectivity, I provided clear instructions to the client on how to reconnect to the Wi-Fi network in case of any disconnection issues. This included troubleshooting steps such as restarting the device, checking for any interference, and verifying the Wi-Fi settings. By empowering the client with this knowledge, I aimed to minimize any potential downtime and ensure a smooth user experience with their newly configured Wi-Fi network.","After remotely accessing the system, I initiated the process by inputting the necessary router details, ensuring a seamless configuration process.

T030781,iApp,OD delete issue ,Employee id 88034 need to delete the OD application on the date of 24th May.,"1. The client reported that employee ID 88034's OD application needs to be deleted because an OD application was already submitted, but the employee is still showing as half-day absent on May 24th.
2. I opened the employee's attendance sheet and found that the employee came late in the first half and was absent in the second half. The employee had applied for second-half leave and first-half OD, but it still showed as absent.
3. I connected to the Zydus server and executed the following queries to delete the OD application:
```sql
SELECT * FROM EmpMaster WHERE Code='88034';
SELECT * FROM adjustapply (NOLOCK) WHERE userid='' AND attddate='2025/05/24' AND category = 'mispunch';
DELETE FROM adjustapply WHERE userid='' AND attddate='2025/05/24' AND category = 'mispunch';
```
4. The OD application was deleted, but the OD hours were still showing in the attendance sheet. To remove them from the table, I executed the following query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM attdmain WHERE empid='' AND attddate='2025-05-24';
```
5. After that, I removed the OD hours and reprocessed the attendance. Now, the OD hours have been removed from the attendance sheet.
6. I opened the attendance sheet again and found that the employee came late in the first half and left early before the second half ended. That is why it was showing as a half-day absence. I guided them that if they want to apply for OD, they must apply for a full first-half OD because the employee both arrived late and left early.
7. After that, we applied the OD application, and now the employee is showing as present in the first half.","1.

This screenshot is shared by her in the morning. Regards. Basant Thapa",Assigning to L2,"Below please find the reason behind the popup message:

To deliver a seamless and intelligent user experience, our app uses the Body Sensors permission specifically to detect physical activity such as walking, driving, or remaining still. This functionality is crucial for features like:

    Accurate activity recognition (e.g., detecting when the user is driving vs. walking)
    Context-aware services such as automatically starting or stopping specific behaviors based on motion state
    Energy-efficient background monitoring without continuous GPS usage

We use the Android Activity Recognition API, which relies on motion sensor data (like accelerometer and gyroscope) provided via the BODY_SENSORS permission. This data helps us determine:

    When the user starts or stops driving
    Whether the user is idle, walking, or running
    When to trigger location-based or time-based logic

Why “Allow All the Time” Is Required

The permission needs to be set to “Allow all the time” so that:

    The app can detect motion states even when running in the background

    Our foreground service that monitors activity transitions can continue working without interruption
    We can avoid delays or missed activity events (especially for time-sensitive or safety-related actions)

The permission needs to be set to “Allow all the time” so that:

    The app can detect motion states even when running in the background

    Our foreground service that monitors activity transitions can continue working without interruption
    We can avoid delays or missed activity events (especially for time-sensitive or safety-related actions)

2. I connected to the Zydus server and checked which locations still had the late entitlement process pending. I ran the following query:
```sql
SELECT l.name, M.ExecuteDate 
FROM MachineData m (NOLOCK) 
JOIN Location l ON m.locationid = l.id 
WHERE m.Status = 'S' AND m.CommandType LIKE '%Payroll%'

4. I waited for each of the 5 locations to complete the process one by one. After completion, I executed the query again to confirm the status and then shared the list of successfully completed locations with the client.","1.

T030802,BIOT,Device not getting online ,Device not getting online ,"After remotely accessing the system, I initiated the process by inputting the necessary router details, ensuring a seamless configuration process. This involved establishing a secure router ID password to safeguard the network from unauthorized access. Next, I carefully configured the Wi-Fi frequency to operate at 2.4 GHz, a common choice for its wider range coverage and compatibility with various devices. This step was crucial in optimizing the network performance for the client's specific needs. Subsequently, I guided the client through the steps required to connect to the newly configured Wi-Fi network using the designated biot application. This involved them through the application interface and assisting them in inputting the required information, such as the network name (SSID) and the secure password. Once the client successfully inputted the necessary details, the connection was established between their device and the Wi-Fi network. This ensured that they could seamlessly access the internet and other network resources without any disruptions. Furthermore, recognizing the importance of ensuring continuous connectivity, I provided clear instructions to the client on how to reconnect to the Wi-Fi network in case of any disconnection issues. This included troubleshooting steps such as restarting the device, checking for any interference, and verifying the Wi-Fi settings. By empowering the client with this knowledge, I aimed to minimize any potential downtime and ensure a smooth user experience with their newly configured Wi-Fi network.","After remotely accessing the system, I initiated the process by inputting the necessary router details, ensuring a seamless configuration process.

This involved establishing a secure router ID password to safeguard the network from unauthorized access. Next, I carefully configured the Wi-Fi frequency to operate at 2.4 GHz, a common choice for its wider range coverage and compatibility with various devices. This step was crucial in optimizing the network performance for the client's specific needs. Subsequently, I guided the client through the steps required to connect to the newly configured Wi-Fi network using the designated biot application. This involved them through the application interface and assisting them in inputting the required information, such as the network name (SSID) and the secure password. Once the client successfully inputted the necessary details, the connection was established between their device and the Wi-Fi network. This ensured that they could seamlessly access the internet and other network resources without any disruptions. Furthermore, recognizing the importance of ensuring continuous connectivity, I provided clear instructions to the client on how to reconnect to the Wi-Fi network in case of any disconnection issues. This included troubleshooting steps such as restarting the device, checking for any interference, and verifying the Wi-Fi settings. By empowering the client with this knowledge, I aimed to minimize any potential downtime and ensure a smooth user experience with their newly configured Wi-Fi network.","After remotely accessing the system, I initiated the process by inputting the necessary router details, ensuring a seamless configuration process.

T030892,ARSWin-Net,Error in downloading data,"Dear Team, Not able to download data Thanks &","We took a remote session with the user and found that the user is using Communication Soft along with ARS Win Pro, both configured to work together.

The current data flow is such that when an employee punches in through Communication Soft, the data reflects in ARS Win Pro. However, to retrieve the punch data in ARS Win Pro, it needs to be downloaded manually.

Upon checking, we found that the user was encountering a syntax error while attempting to download the data. To resolve this, we performed multiple troubleshooting steps using SQL DBX, as the client is using an MDB database.

Eventually, we discovered that the issue was due to an incorrectly named ARS Win log file in the application folder. This incorrect file name was causing data misalignment, which in turn triggered an error when the user attempted to download specific records.

We corrected the problematic record and renamed the ARSWin log file appropriately. After making these changes, the user was able to start the download process successfully. The user has confirmed that all data is now displaying correctly and the system is functioning as expected.","We took a remote session with the user and found that the user is using Communication Soft along with ARS Win Pro, both configured to work together.

T030895,iApp,Minutes of Meeting (Spectra and Veeda). Urgent: Negative Leave Balance Issue,"Dear Sandip,

I would like to understand the provisions available within the system concerning the annual leave card, specifically regarding the following points:

    For leaves that were previously in force but no longer exist currently, is it necessary to continue displaying them in the annual leave card?
    There are two different categories of Privilege Leave (PL) as follows:
    a) Privilege Leave (PL) – Not in use currently
    b) PLM – Privilege Leave balance is being updated only in PLM

Since the first category is no longer applicable or in force, we would like to hide this section to remove unnecessary leave types from the annual leave card.

This requirement is quite fundamental for any organization, as leave categories often change over time due to business needs and policy compliance. Therefore, it is essential that the attendance system provides the flexibility to manage and control such scenarios. We have already assessed several tools where this functionality is available.

Please advise if there is a satisfactory solution within our current system to address these important requirements.

Looking forward to your guidance.

SUNIL KUMAR : 9953173454","Please find below our observations based on today’s remote session:

    The client is using NetXsControl software.

    As informed by the site engineer (M - 9811284660), no cards have been assigned to any users yet.  Users have not started using the system.

    According to a member of the client’s team, they have not received any handover, and software utilization has not yet started.

    During the remote session, we observed that all transactions recorded were through the SWITCH only.

    Even after assigning access from the software, users were unable to punch on most devices. This could be due to hardware issues or incorrect wiring connections.

To verify and resolve the issue, we recommend a site visit by our engineer.  Please confirm , so that we can share the applicable charges.

Additionally, please share the installation certificate and client handover documentation from the time of installation.",

2. I opened the Employee Master menu, edited the employee details, navigated to the Miscellaneous menu, and found that two in-out records from the turnstile device were already present.
3. After that, I accessed the Zydus server and went to the Data Log File menu. However, the page was loading slowly and the server was not responding properly. I waited for some time, then copied all the data log files for May 17th and extracted them using the Log Extractor executable.

T030943,BIOT,Client wants to change wi-fi name and password.,Client wants to change wi-fi name and password.,"After remotely accessing the system, I initiated the process by inputting the necessary router details, ensuring a seamless configuration process. This involved establishing a secure router ID password to safeguard the network from unauthorized access. Next, I carefully configured the Wi-Fi frequency to operate at 2.4 GHz, a common choice for its wider range coverage and compatibility with various devices. This step was crucial in optimizing the network performance for the client's specific needs. Subsequently, I guided the client through the steps required to connect to the newly configured Wi-Fi network using the designated biot application. This involved them through the application interface and assisting them in inputting the required information, such as the network name (SSID) and the secure password. Once the client successfully inputted the necessary details, the connection was established between their device and the Wi-Fi network. This ensured that they could seamlessly access the internet and other network resources without any disruptions. Furthermore, recognizing the importance of ensuring continuous connectivity, I provided clear instructions to the client on how to reconnect to the Wi-Fi network in case of any disconnection issues. This included troubleshooting steps such as restarting the device, checking for any interference, and verifying the Wi-Fi settings. By empowering the client with this knowledge, I aimed to minimize any potential downtime and ensure a smooth user experience with their newly configured Wi-Fi network.","After remotely accessing the system, I initiated the process by inputting the necessary router details, ensuring a seamless configuration process.

During testing, we observed that when a card is swiped on one door, it shows the correct card ID, but on the second door, a different card ID is displayed. Upon converting both card IDs to binary format, we found that the second one is the bitwise opposite of the first. Based on this, we recommended swapping the D0 and D1 wire connections for that reader. Additionally, the same issue was observed on two other controllers. We advised performing the same action—swapping the D0 and D1 (or D1 and D1in, depending on the wiring)—for the affected readers on those controllers as well.

I am writing to bring to your attention an ongoing issue we are facing with the SPECTRA system.

Currently, the Pre-registration visitor list is not loading on the Front Desk interface. Instead of the expected data, an ""error"" message is being displayed, which is preventing us from registering visitors and causing operational challenges.

 

Additionally, I would like to follow up on the previous issue I had reported regarding discrepancies in the SPECTRA headcount report — where data was not displaying correctly. This matter still appears unresolved.

 

We would appreciate it if both of these concerns could be addressed on priority. Please let me know if you require any further details to assist with troubleshooting.

T031019,iApp,Visit moraiya location for hardware and software issue,Visit moraiya locations to update the all the IP in devices and in software also and other software related concerns. ,"As per the site visit scheduled by Mr. Jignesh Prajapati for hardware and software activities at the Zydus Moraiya site, the task was to change the IP range on all devices due to a 3-day downtime at the site.
1. I visited the Moraiya site and met with the IT team to discuss the current IP range and determine which range needs to be updated for all devices.
2. I generated a list of devices from the central software, including attendance, access, and canteen devices, and shared it with Mr. Utsav from the IT team. We discussed which devices require IP changes, particularly those not in the 30-series range.
3. After the discussion, I filtered out the IPs not in the 30-series range and requested Mr. Utsav to provide new static IPs for those devices. I also requested that these IPs be updated in the software accordingly.
4. I identified another software, NetXSControl, running on a desktop system, with 99 devices connected. I exported the data, separated the active and inactive devices, and found that 31 devices are currently active. I shared this list with the IT team.
5. It was found that the NetXS software was not downloading data for several days due to the SQL database being full. We archived the data and requested the IT team to increase the SQL database size and update the SQL license.
6. I created the final list of devices that required IP changes. Along with Mr. Raj from the hardware team, we visited each device location across the site, connected to them one by one via laptop, and changed their IPs using the Bootloader application.
7. I also updated the IPs for all devices one by one in the software.
8. After the IP changes, the devices were still not showing as active. Upon checking with the IT team, it was found that VLAN configuration was required. I shared each device’s old IP, new IP, and MAC address with the IT team. They then configured VLAN bindings for all IP addresses with their respective MAC addresses. After some time, all devices became active in the software.
9. I met with the security head, Mr. Sushil Punia, and addressed the concerns related to the NetXS software. I also guided them on how to remove unwanted users from the NetXSControl software to free up license capacity, as the license limit had been reached.
10.

This step was crucial in optimizing the network performance for the client's specific needs. Subsequently, I guided the client through the steps required to connect to the newly configured Wi-Fi network using the designated biot application. This involved them through the application interface and assisting them in inputting the required information, such as the network name (SSID) and the secure password. Once the client successfully inputted the necessary details, the connection was established between their device and the Wi-Fi network. This ensured that they could seamlessly access the internet and other network resources without any disruptions. Furthermore, recognizing the importance of ensuring continuous connectivity, I provided clear instructions to the client on how to reconnect to the Wi-Fi network in case of any disconnection issues.

Next, I carefully configured the Wi-Fi frequency to operate at 2.4 GHz, a common choice for its wider range coverage and compatibility with various devices. This step was crucial in optimizing the network performance for the client's specific needs. Subsequently, I guided the client through the steps required to connect to the newly configured Wi-Fi network using the designated biot application. This involved them through the application interface and assisting them in inputting the required information, such as the network name (SSID) and the secure password. Once the client successfully inputted the necessary details, the connection was established between their device and the Wi-Fi network. This ensured that they could seamlessly access the internet and other network resources without any disruptions. Furthermore, recognizing the importance of ensuring continuous connectivity, I provided clear instructions to the client on how to reconnect to the Wi-Fi network in case of any disconnection issues. This included troubleshooting steps such as restarting the device, checking for any interference, and verifying the Wi-Fi settings. By empowering the client with this knowledge, I aimed to minimize any potential downtime and ensure a smooth user experience with their newly configured Wi-Fi network.

Thank you for assigning the ticket.

We are facing a similar issue with one of our clients, Wockhardt. The application EXE is running in the background but is not appearing on the frontend.

We have verified the SQL connection and ODBC settings, and the connection is successfully established. Upon further investigation, we identified that the EXE was being blocked by the firewall and antivirus software on the client side.

We advised the client to whitelist the application EXE in both the firewall and antivirus. After doing so, the software started working as expected on the frontend.

Kindly request you to ensure the EXE is whitelisted in both the firewall and antivirus settings, and then check if the issue is resolved.

This involved establishing a secure router ID password to safeguard the network from unauthorized access. Next, I carefully configured the Wi-Fi frequency to operate at 2.4 GHz, a common choice for its wider range coverage and compatibility with various devices. This step was crucial in optimizing the network performance for the client's specific needs. Subsequently, I guided the client through the steps required to connect to the newly configured Wi-Fi network using the designated biot application. This involved them through the application interface and assisting them in inputting the required information, such as the network name (SSID) and the secure password. Once the client successfully inputted the necessary details, the connection was established between their device and the Wi-Fi network. This ensured that they could seamlessly access the internet and other network resources without any disruptions. Furthermore, recognizing the importance of ensuring continuous connectivity, I provided clear instructions to the client on how to reconnect to the Wi-Fi network in case of any disconnection issues.

 ","Dear Sir,

As per the trailing mail and our recent discussion, we have checked the Biostamp 3S controller. When punching through the card, access is granted successfully. However, when attempting to punch via the Xp P1 reader, we are encountering the error: ""45.45 Unknown"".

Based on our conversation, this appears to be a connection-related issue. Therefore, we kindly request you to arrange an engineer visit to the Veeda Mehsana location to investigate and resolve the issue at the earliest.

Please find the attachment for your reference.

The quantity limit is set to 25, but when swiping on the canteen device, it only allowed one item and did not accept multiple swipes.
2. I connected with the client to understand the actual issue and requested them to share the card IDs. The client provided the card IDs, and I went to the ""Assign Access"" menu to check which access group was assigned to each card.
3. I filtered the card IDs and found that they belonged to three different locations: Biologics, VTC, and Fill & Finish. I checked each one individually and found that the ""Guest Canteen"" group was not assigned to these cards, which is why only one punch was allowed per day.
4. I assigned the ""Guest Canteen"" group to each card ID, and now it is working fine.","1. The client reported that three guest canteen cards were not working. The quantity limit is set to 25, but when swiping on the canteen device, it only allowed one item and did not accept multiple swipes.

T031359,,NetXs Control Missing Transaction,"Dear Team,We are encountering an issue with the NetXs Control. Upon checking last month's data for April 2025, we noticed a gap of approximately 10 days of transaction records missing from the software. We have confirmed that there were no power interruptions during those days, and the NetXs Control was operational. However, we haven't been able to recover these missing transactions.We are now facing a similar problem this month, May 2025. So far, we can only find transaction records for 3 to 4 days, with the remaining data missing from the NetXs Control software. Despite the system collecting data regularly, we have been unsuccessful in retrieving the missing transactions even after attempting to repair the database.Please support us. We require your urgent support to investigate and resolve this recurring issue.Thanks & RegardsMohammad Ali ShahInfoSec & Network SecurityUnit S- 220A , Eastern Business District ,LBS Marg, Near Metro, Bhandup West,Mumbai, Maharashtra 400078Save a Tree.

Database Query Execution: To assess the number of active users consuming licenses, I executed the following SQL query on the Zydus server: ```sql SELECT COUNT(*) AS UsersCnt FROM ( SELECT A.ID AS UsersCnt FROM allusers A JOIN UserMapping B ON A.LocationID = B.LocationID AND A.ID = B.UserID WHERE ISNULL(A.isinactive, 'N') <> 'R' AND ( ISNULL(AttendancePolicy, 0) <> 0 OR ISNULL(LeavePolicy, 0) <> 0 OR ISNULL(OvertimePolicy, 0) <> 0 OR ISNULL(LateEarlyPolicy, 0) <> 0 OR ISNULL(WeekOffPolicy, 0) <> 0 OR ISNULL(HolidayPolicy, 0) <> 0 OR ISNULL(ShiftPattern, 0) <> 0 OR ISNULL(TourPolicy, 0) <> 0 OR ISNULL(DeductionPolicy, 0) <> 0 ) UNION SELECT A.ID AS UsersCnt FROM allusers A JOIN ARSUserAccess B ON A.LocationID = B.LocationID AND A.ID = B.UserID WHERE ISNULL(A.isinactive, 'N') <> 'R' AND B.TzGrpid IS NOT NULL UNION SELECT DISTINCT A.ID AS UsersCnt FROM allusers A JOIN UserGlobalAccess B ON A.ID = B.EmpID WHERE ISNULL(A.isinactive, 'N') <> 'R' AND B.category = 'A' AND B.TzGrpid NOT IN ('0', '', NULL) ) AS a; ``` 4. License Utilization Analysis: The query revealed that 26,079 licenses are currently in use, whereas the available license limit is 26,000. This overage necessitated the removal of certain contract employees to free up licenses. 5.

4. License Utilization Analysis:
The query revealed that 26,079 licenses are currently in use, whereas the available license limit is 26,000. This overage necessitated the removal of certain contract employees to free up licenses.
5. Removal of Contract Employees:
   To address the license overage, I executed the following SQL update query to mark the contract employees as inactive:
   ```sql
   UPDATE AllUsers
   SET ResignDate = '2024-09-18',
       RelieveDate = '2024-09-18',
       IsInactive = 'R',
       ResignReason = 'RDBCanteen'
   WHERE EmpCode IN ('KE0010', 'KE0018', 'KE0019', 'KE0022', 'KE0025', 'KE0026');
   ```
6. Post-Action Verification:
--> After removing the contract employees, I reopened the software, and it is now functioning properly across all locations.","1. Client Report:

4. License Utilization Analysis:
The query revealed that 26,079 licenses are currently in use, whereas the available license limit is 26,000. This overage necessitated the removal of certain contract employees to free up licenses.
5. Removal of Contract Employees:
   To address the license overage, I executed the following SQL update query to mark the contract employees as inactive:
   ```sql
   UPDATE AllUsers
   SET ResignDate = '2024-09-18',
       RelieveDate = '2024-09-18',
       IsInactive = 'R',

   WHERE EmpCode IN ('KE0010', 'KE0018', 'KE0019', 'KE0022', 'KE0025', 'KE0026');
   ```
6. Post-Action Verification:
--> After removing the contract employees, I reopened the software, and it is now functioning properly across all locations.","1. Client Report:
   The client reported that the IAPP software is not operational at all Zydus locations.
2. Initial Investigation:
   Upon accessing the software, I identified a ""license limit full"" error, indicating that the attendance license capacity had been reached. Consequently, attempting to access the time and attendance module resulted in the software being unresponsive.
3. Database Query Execution:
   To assess the number of active users consuming licenses, I executed the following SQL query on the Zydus server:
   ```sql

As discussed with Mr. Dinesh, out of the three tower lifts, two are functioning properly. However, one lift is allowing unauthorized (stranger) access to all floors.

We consulted with our hardware team and found that when the face device sends a Wiegand output, the Spectra controller grants floor access based on the received data. In the case of a stranger, the device is still sending a Wiegand output, which results in unrestricted access to all floors.

To resolve this issue, as suggested please contact to your face device vendor to configure the device not to send any Wiegand output when a stranger scan is detected. This will ensure that access is denied in such cases and the issue will be resolved.

Please coordinate with your vendor accordingly and let us know once the change is implemented.",

2. Initial Investigation: Upon accessing the software's database menu, I found one device marked as inactive and another as active but with fewer fingerprints registered. This discrepancy was causing punch access issues for numerous employees.
3. Network Connectivity Check: I pinged the offline device's IP from the Zydus server and found it unresponsive. I contacted the client to visit the device's location to verify the network parameters.
4. Network Parameter Correction: The client checked the device's network settings and discovered incorrect configurations. I guided them to input the correct gateway, server port, and server IP. After updating these settings, the device became active and responsive.
5. Pending Transactions: In the software, I observed over 1,100 pending transactions on the device. I advised the client to allow some time for these transactions to clear.

2. First, I needed to install the device; however, the power adapter was not available. The client arranged for the power adapter.
3. Once the device was connected, I coordinated with the IT team to assign an IP address. I shared the active device IP list with them, and multiple IPs (3-4) were assigned to the device. However, the device’s IP was not pinging on the Zydus server.
4. According to Mr. Ravi from the IT team, the VLAN port needed to be assigned to the device. He visited the device location, enabled the VLAN port, and after that, the device IP began pinging correctly.
5. I then went to the item master and created 3 new items, along with the corresponding time zone and item group for those items.
6. I added the device, selected the canteen, and enabled the option for multiple item selections.
7. After testing the device, I discovered the firmware was outdated. I updated the device to the latest canteen firmware.
8. Despite the update, the punch system was still not working. Upon further inspection, I found that the device's IP was still not functioning properly, and commands were not being sent. I removed and reinserted the LAN cable, and the device IP started working.
9. Finally, I checked the punch system again, and the item selection displayed correctly. The punches are now working as expected.","1. The client reported the need to configure a new canteen device at the Zydus corporate site for the VIP manager and create a new canteen setup.

3. User Hierarchy Review: I navigated to the user hierarchy menu and identified that the primary approval manager had already been assigned to the same employee within the hierarchy. This duplicate assignment was causing the system to flag the error.
4. Resolution Guidance: I advised the client to first remove the employee from the primary approval list and then reassign them.

T031687,iApp,Employee showing absent ,"Employee ID 140415 at the ZRC location had late permission auto-applied, but the employee is still marked as half-day absent on that day.
","1. The client reported that the late permission for Employee ID 140415 was auto-applied for 20th May 2025, but the employee is still marked as half-day absent in the ZRC location.
2. Upon reviewing the employee's attendance sheet, I observed that the employee's flag is marked as ""AH-PH,"" indicating a half-day absence. I examined the attendance punches for that day and found only two entries: one for clock-in and one for clock-out.
3. The employee's late duration was recorded as 01:58 hours. According to the company's late permission policy, employees are permitted a grace period of up to 02:00 hours.
4. To investigate further, I accessed the Zydus server and executed the following queries:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM empmaster WHERE code='140415';
   SELECT * FROM adjustapply WHERE userid='140415' AND attddate='2025-05-20';
   ```
5. The query results confirmed that the late permission application exists in the database. Since it is not possible to delete this record through the front-end interface, I proceeded to remove it directly from the database.
6. I executed the following SQL query to delete the late permission record:
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM adjustapply WHERE userid='140415' AND attddate='2025-05-20';
   ```
7. Next, I deleted the permission percentage by executing the following query:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM attdmain WHERE empid='140415' AND attddate='2025-05-20';
   ```
8. I updated the `lateper` field to `NULL` for the specified date. After making this change, I reprocessed the attendance sheet, and the late permission was successfully removed.
9. Finally, I reapplied the late permission through the attendance sheet interface. Upon application, the employee's status for that day was updated to ""Present.","1.
